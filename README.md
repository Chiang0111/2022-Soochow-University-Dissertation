# 2022-Soochow-University-Dissertation

This is a project of a dissertation competition from an bachelor degree of economics student from Soochow University.
## Description

This study employs autoregressive and cross-period regression models from time series analysis, using various cryptocurrency prices as variables to predict the future returns of Ethereum. We find that platform tokens are the most suitable variables for predicting Ethereum returns. Additionally, we discover that NFT-related digital currencies, which are traded on the Ethereum blockchain, can also predict Ethereum returns. Conversely, DeFi-related tokens and meme coins are the least suitable for predicting Ethereum returns.
